TLDR: Dark Reader has issues with certain sites if you open pages in a new tab.
https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/issues/6350

This is especially annoying when it happens on sites like like MyAnimeList and Wikidot where you might naturally be opening a lot of seperate tabs.

Exporting the generated theme and using them in Stylus avoids this issue.
While allowing me to also make adjustments for certain sites like Wikidot that need them.

I needed a place to store these that'll let me do a once click install them so I can get this on my phone.
Since I can't just directly import the theme with the current state of things there, even by copy and paste means since I can't edit themes on it.

So just jamming them here seems like the best option, since this repo already exists for the sake of my profile anyway.
I'd rather not make a repo for something I didn't make or have to find a weird one off like pastebin that'd work for this.
